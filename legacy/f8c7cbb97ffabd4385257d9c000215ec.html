                            Spares
                            Policy draft Nov. 17, 2015</h1>


                        The
                        Issue


                        <p>
                        </p>

                        The Kanata Masters League is currently well
                        balanced, 2 points separates second and sixth place in
                        the standings. We are however getting many negative comments and
                        frustration that the outcome of some games is determined by elite spares added
                        to the roster. Every team has enjoyed the supercharging of adding an elite
                        spare as well as the sting of losing to a supercharged team.


                        <p>Let's�call it a draw and fix the problem.</p>

                        <p><b>Spares Policy</b></p>


                        <p><b>Captains </b>are obliged to run a tight ship and to put the onus on
                            players to inform
                            them well in advance that they will miss a game. (shit happens that is why we
                            can grab spares at game time, this should be the exception not the rule)</p>


                        <p><b>Players </b>the onus is on you to notify your captain if you will be
                            missing a game,
                            it resolves many issues if you do. Players if asked to spare at the last minute
                            please help out the league and spare.</p>


                        <p>For health and safety reasons we encourage
                            teams to play with a minimum of 10 skaters with 9 as your absolute
                            minimum.<b>If a team at game time has less
                                than 9 players, the opposing team should loan them players as practical, or
                                they may approve the use of an elite player.
                                <b>*** should they forfeit the
                                    game??Spares may come from the spares list or from team
                                    rosters, all players are rated 1 to 10, these ratings are also utilized when
                                    setting up balanced <b> teams.</b></b></b></p>


                        <h2>1.<b> Roster Players are divided into 3
                            catagories for spares purposes</b></h2>


                        <p>Elite players rated 9 or 10 cannot spare.</p>


                        <p>Restricted players rated 8 may spare with the
                            following caveat, the team requiring the spare must be missing at least 1
                            player rated 8 or higher and if a second spare is required they must use a
                            spare rated 7 or lower.</p>


                        <p><b>Regular players rated 7 or
                            below who have no restrictions to spare.</b></p>


                        <h2>2.<b>Spares List <b>Players</b></b></h2>


                        <p>
                        </p>

                        <p>The league maintains a list of players who have
                            indicated that they wish to spare in the Masters.<b> These players are also rated and
                                classified as either Restricted
                                (8 and above ) or Regular (1-7)</b></p>


                        <p><b> Process to
                            Request Spares</b></p>


                        <p>Request for spare must be sent to the spares
                            coordinator prior to the day of the game, with a copy to the opposing
                            captain.<b>Please state which players you
                                are missing, and if you require a defenceman or forward, an attempt to provide
                                a suitable spare will be made. </b></p>


                        <p>If a spare is assigned they will play, even if a
                            missing player unexpectedly shows up.<b>If
                                the player (rated 8 or higher) happens to show up the spare will be offered
                                first to the other team. <b><b></b></b></b></p>


                        <h2>4.<b>Game day requests for spares</b></h2>


                        <p>Captains will be provided a contact list for both Roster
                            and Spare players and on game day they are responsible to find suitable spares
                            and to notify the opposing captain.<b> On
                                game day including game time spares you may only use regular players (rated 1
                                to 7),<b>� this puts further onus on players
                                    to keep their captains informed if they are missing a game.<b></b></b></b></p>


                        <p>Priority should be given to:</p>


                        <ul>
                            <li><p>
                                Players on spare list;

                        </ul>


                        <p>Captains must notify opposing captain before game
                            who is sparing.</p>


                        <p><b>5.<b>Spare Goalies</b></b></p>


                        <p>Captains are responsible to find their own spare
                            goalies, a list of goalies wishing to spare has been provided.<b>Teams with low rated
                                goalies should only ask the
                                high ranked goalies to spare as a last resort, in keeping with the philosophy
                                of a balanced league.<b>As always keep the
                                    opposing captain informed.</b></b></p>


                        <h2>6.<b>Cost to spare</b></h2>


                        <p>Players from the Spares List <b>pay $10 game and it is a great way to
                            introduce the players to our league and for the league to observe if they are a
                            good fit. Most of our new players are first introduced as a spare, it
                            is an excellent feeder system.<b></b></b></p>


                        <p>Note roster players and goalies do not pay to
                            spare.</p>

                            Playoffs</b></p>


                        <p>Historically captains have agreed just prior to the
                            playoffs to tighten up who can spare and exclude certain goalies .</p>
